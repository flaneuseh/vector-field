# Svelte Vector Field and Integrators

A simple Svelte project for simulating motion along a vector field using a variety of integration methods. View the [demos](https://github.com/flaneuseh/vector-field/blob/main/demos)!

Before you start, `npm` must be installed.

To run the vector field, run the commands `npm install` and `npm run start` in the terminal. Then
the app should open at `http://localhost:5000` (or another port if 5000 is
unavailable).

You can select any of 4 integrators.
Click the screen to add a ball with the selected integrator.
Each ball uses an integrator independently of the other balls.
You can adjust the Vx and Vy equations and the dt and max velocity values.
